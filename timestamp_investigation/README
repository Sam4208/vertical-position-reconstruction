Content of the software directory
=================================

Initial content:
----------------

- macro.C
- Makefile
- LinkDef.h

Generated content (see #Commands section)
-----------------------------------------

- myDictionary.cxx (from rootcling command)
- myDictionary_rdict.pcm (from rootcling command)
- myDictionary.o (shared library file produced after compiling the ROOT dictionary with g++)
- macro.o (shared library produced with the Makefile)
- macro.exe (final executable)



Commands
========


Generate ROOT dictionary
------------------------

$ rootcling -f myDictionary.cxx LinkDef.h

It generates 2 new files called 'myDictionary.cxx' and 'myDictionary_rdict.pcm' that will be used by ROOT to understand how to have access to a nested std::vector<std::vector> >.


Compile ROOT dictionary with g++
--------------------------------

$ g++ -c `root-config --cflags --libs`  myDictionary.cxx

It compiles the myDictionary.cxx into a shared library myDictionary.o



Compiling the ROOT macro from the Makefile
------------------------------------------

$ make

It generates 2 new files again. One is the shared library for the macro: macro.o and the last one is the executable you will use macro.exe


Executing the ROOT macro
------------------------

$ ./macro.exe

It will produced an output ROOT file where you save your plots, distribution or spectrum (TH1D, TH2D...)
